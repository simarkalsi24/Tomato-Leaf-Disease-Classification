# 🍅 Tomato Leaf Disease Classification using CNN and Optimization Algorithms

This repository presents a deep learning-based approach to classify tomato leaf diseases using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and four bio-inspired optimization algorithms to improve performance:

- 🧠 **Base CNN Model**
- 🦋 CNN + **Dragonfly Algorithm**
- 🧲 CNN + **Hybrid PSO**
- 🐳 CNN + **Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)**
- 🦁 CNN + **Ant Lion Optimization (ALO)**
