This project demonstrates how the Dragonfly algorithm can be integrated with a CNN for supervised learning tasks. The Dragonfly optimizer is inspired by the static and dynamic swarming behaviors of dragonflies in nature and is well-suited for finding optimal hyperparameters or weights in complex models.

About the Dragonfly Algorithm
Type: Metaheuristic optimizer
Inspired by: Dragonfly swarming behaviors (static (feeding), dynamic (migration))
Use in ML: Used for optimization tasks such as hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and training weights for neural networks.
